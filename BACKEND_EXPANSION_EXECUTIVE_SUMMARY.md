## 🎓 Key Recommendations

### ✅ DO (Must Have)
1. **Start with Phase 1** - Foundation features are prerequisites
2. **Build Quick Wins first** - 2-3 week sprint for morale/momentum
3. **Multi-tenant early** - Hardest feature, most value
4. **Invest in architecture** - Caching, indexing, denormalization
5. **Security first** - RBAC, audit logging from the start

### ⚠️ DON'T (Avoid)
1. **Skip database design** - Will cause rework later
2. **Ignore performance** - Analytics queries will timeout
3. **Postpone mobile** - Market opportunity too large
4. **Over-engineer early** - MVP first, then optimize
5. **Forget user feedback** - Test with real users often

### 💡 CONSIDER (Nice to Have)
1. **Machine Learning** - Demand forecasting (Phase 3)
2. **Mobile-first** - Consider building mobile first (rethink roadmap)
3. **Open API** - If partner ecosystem desired
4. **White-label** - If reseller channel planned
5. **Advanced compliance** - If international expansion planned
