# PR: Responsive layout fixes + visual test modernization

Summary

This PR contains a focused set of changes to improve responsiveness across POS screens and to modernize the visual test harness:

- Modernized visual responsive tests to use `WidgetTester.view` APIs (replaced deprecated `window` test helpers).

- Hardened high-risk POS screens (Retail, Cafe, Table POS) to avoid RenderFlex/RenderBox overflow on short/narrow viewports by applying defensive scroll/constraint patterns.

- Fixed two analyzer suggestions (braces and super-parameters) to keep `flutter analyze` clean.

Why

The app previously produced RenderFlex overflow exceptions when rendered at some short/narrow sizes (phone portrait), causing UI breakage. The visual tests reproduced those failures. These changes harden layouts by ensuring panels that can exceed available height are wrapped in constrained, scrollable containers and that inner lists are `Flexible` so the overall panel can scroll instead of overflow.

Files/areas changed (high level)

- Tests:

  - `test/visual/responsive_screens_test.dart` — replaced deprecated test window helpers with `tester.view` APIs and reset calls.

- Widgets / screens (key fixes):

  - `lib/screens/retail_pos_screen.dart` — cart sidebar: wrapped in LayoutBuilder + SingleChildScrollView + ConstrainedBox(minHeight) + IntrinsicHeight and used Flexible for inner lists.

  - `lib/screens/cafe_pos_screen.dart` — cart panel: same defensive wrapper and Flexible list area.

  - `lib/screens/pos_order_screen_fixed.dart` — per-table POS: constrained cart area for narrow screens and defensive wrapper for wide layout.

- Small lints fixed:

  - `lib/widgets/responsive_layout.dart` — used `super.key` in constructor.

  - `lib/screens/items_management_screen.dart` — wrapped single-line `if` body in braces.

Verification done

- `flutter analyze` — no issues found.

- `flutter test` — all tests pass, including visual/responsive harness (tested sizes: 360x800, 812x375, 800x1280, 1366x768).

Notes / Risk

- Changes are intentionally minimal and localized to avoid behavioral changes. The defensive pattern preserves UX but prevents overflow by allowing scrolling where necessary.

- I did not apply the defensive pattern blindly across every screen. I audited management screens (`users`, `printers`, `items`, `business_info`) and found no immediate unbounded Column/Expanded anti-patterns that needed fixes.

Database migration (security)

- This release includes a data migration to improve PIN security. User PINs previously stored as plaintext in the SQLite `users.pin` column are now migrated into an encrypted local store (Hive + platform secure storage) and the `pin` column is removed from the on-disk schema.

- Technical details:

  - Database schema version bumped to v5.

  - During upgrade the app will attempt to copy any existing plaintext `pin` values into the encrypted `PinStore` and then recreate the `users` table without the `pin` column.

  - The migration is non-destructive: existing PINs are preserved and automatically encrypted on upgrade.

- Operator note: No manual action is required. On next app start the migration runs automatically.

- Developer note: A test `test/migration/pin_migration_test.dart` was added to simulate the v4 -> v5 migration and verify the pin move and schema change.

How to push & open a PR

If you want me to push the branch to your remote, add the remote or tell me the remote URL and I'll push and prepare a PR draft title/body.

Example commands you can run locally to push and open a PR:

```bash

# add your remote (only needed once)

git remote add origin git@github.com:youruser/flutterpos.git


# push branch

git push -u origin responsive/layout-fixes


# Then open a PR on GitHub from responsive/layout-fixes -> main with the title:

# "Responsive: harden POS layouts & modernize visual tests"

```text

Suggested PR body (copy into GitHub):

Title: Responsive: harden POS layouts & modernize visual tests

Body: See this file (`docs/PR_DRAFT.md`) for details. Key points:


- Modernized visual test APIs

- Fixed RenderFlex overflow by adding defensive, scrollable wrappers for cart/side panels

- All tests and analyzer are clean locally

Next steps (recommended)

1. CI: run `flutter test` and `flutter analyze` in CI across stable Flutter channel. Add the visual responsive test to CI so future regressions are caught.
2. Optional: selectively apply the defensive pattern to additional screens if you want maximum guardrail coverage.
3. Add a short UI acceptance test (manual check) for the POS screens at a small phone size to ensure the user experience of scrolling is acceptable.

Contact me if you want me to push the branch and open the PR for you (provide remote), or I can prepare a patch/zip for review.
